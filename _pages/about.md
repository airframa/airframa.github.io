I am a graduate researcher at the [Multimedia Lab (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at CUHK, under the supervision of [Prof. Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). My research focuses on advancing perception systems, 3D/4D vision, and scene reconstruction techniques, with particular emphasis on neural representations and rendering. Currently, I am investigating the application of Gaussian Splatting for efficient scene reconstruction, targeting dynamic environments like urban streetscapes.

I hold a Master's degree from ETH Zürich, where I specialized in control systems and computer vision, and a Bachelor's degree from Politecnico di Milano. Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Audi F1 Project](https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/formula-1-14842) (formerly [Sauber](https://www.sauber-group.com/)), where I developed 3D aerodynamic data processing techniques for the development of the Formula 1 car, including point cloud registration, segmentation and rasterization, as well as algorithms for flow feature classification. My journey included also various experiences in the aerospace and robotics sector. 

In my free time, I like to sail, a sport that I picked up while growing up on the shores of Lake Como, Italy, as well as taking pictures on old analog film cameras. When I am not outdoor, I like learning new languages or reading. I am currently learning Mandarin.
祝我好运!
