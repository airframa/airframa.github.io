I am a graduate researcher at the [Multimedia Lab (MMLab)](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at CUHK, in [Prof. Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/)'s group. I am interested in developing intelligent systems that are able to interact safely and robustly with their environments. My research focuses on 3D/4D vision, aiming to advance perception systems and scene reconstruction techniques, with particular emphasis on neural representations and rendering. This direction supports a broad range of applications, from autonomous systems to
augmented and virtual reality, and is grounded in my recent research experiences, which have deepened my interest in
these fields. Currently, I am exploring monocular depth estimation techniques and investigating the application of Gaussian Splatting for efficient scene reconstruction, targeting challenging dynamic environments like urban streetscapes.

I hold a Master's degree from ETH Zürich, where I specialized in control systems and computer vision, and a Bachelor's degree from Politecnico di Milano. Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Audi F1 Project](https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/formula-1-14842) (formerly [Sauber](https://www.sauber-group.com/)), where I developed 3D aerodynamic data processing techniques for the development of the Formula 1 car, including point cloud registration, segmentation and rasterization, as well as algorithms for flow feature classification. My journey included various experiences in the aerospace and robotics sector as well. 

In my free time, I like to sail, a sport that I picked up while growing up on the shores of Lake Como, Italy, as well as taking pictures on old analog film cameras. When I am not outdoor, I like learning new languages or reading. I am currently learning Mandarin.\\
祝我好运!
